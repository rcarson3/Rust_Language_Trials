# Rust_Language_Trials
Just Rust trials that run through the various examples given in the Rust Language book

Plan on running through the different chapters and everything from the Rust Language book with additional comments for each subject to help me better understand the material. It'll also contain copy and pastes from the book that I found to be a good enough explanation.
